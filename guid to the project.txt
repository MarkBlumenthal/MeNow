In this project I used Node.Js for the server side using express.
Created and API endpoint with a JSON file to retrieve the 
data to display.

For the frontend I used React with Vite.

The frontend fetches the top 5 images/products from the API
and displays them in a card format with the picture, keyword
and score.

A user is able to search the API with certain keywords or 
display images/products randomly.
If a keyword is searched and not contained in the API a message
is displayed saying "no product exsits for that keyword".

A user is also able to update the score and it also updates
the score on the API side.

CSS and Bootstrap is used for styling.
 
I was not able to use the API links for the images that were
provided. For some reason React and HTML do not read Google
drive links correctly and the images were not displaying. I 
then downloaded the images locally and used the local links
in the API.

To run the app install:


npm install express body-parser fs - allow server to read the objects
npm install axios - used to make the HTTP requests
npm install bootstrap - used for styling
npm install react-bootstrap - used for styling
npm install cors - used to allow these cross-domain requests as backend and frontend are running on different domains.



Run the backend:
node server.js

Run the frontend:
npm run dev
